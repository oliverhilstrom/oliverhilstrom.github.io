    In the beginning of quarentine I was playing Animal Crossing New Horizons every day, and now I don't play it as often, but am keeping my town up to date.
</br>
    If you want to add me on my switch my code is SW-5198-0375-2123 :)) 
</br>
    I don't play Minecraft as much as I do in the summer, that is just because of school. 
</br>
    I started playing Celeste last year, I took a very long break and forgot about it. Now I play it on and off, I am almost at the end as well.
